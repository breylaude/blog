# If you're looking to contact me
The best way to reach me is via [email](mailto:laude822@gmail.com), not social networks, you can also [call](tel:+639365671353) but I prefer e-mail for "cold calls."

### contributions

#### site reliability engineering

- led [redacted] move from VPSes + ansible to kubernetes, giving us an immutable infrastructure with autoscaling, internal DNS, and blue-green deployment
- reduced [redacted] GCP bill by 50% in a cost optimization project, mostly through benchmarking and right-sizing requests
- enabled observability by setting up alerting & metrics via Prometheus & Grafana, distributed tracing via OpenCensus & Stackdriver Trace, and error reporting; decreasing mean time to repair by making it easier to diagnose incidents rapidly, and making it easy to optimize hotspots by allowing deep dives into endpoint execution.
- transitioned container building from Jenkins to cloud build, increasing reliability and parallelism for container builds.

#### cybersecurity - (Laude Technologies)

- collaborated on international projects with governments and large organizations worldwide.
- worked on hardening security and evaluating systems, devices, applications and networks.
- led [redacted] for cybersecurity provider, giving advice on building services and operation capabilities, and providing support on projects for their customer base. developed project to evaluate security managed services and assess operations based on industry practices and standards for SOC/CSIRTs.
- expanded vulnerability management automation from 360k vulnerabilities in 2019 to over 1.2 Million vulnerabilities in 2021
- drove integrations of 3rd party APIs to completion, including AWS, ServiceNow, Dome9, and Aqua Security.
- designed the continuous automation processes utilized with container vulnerability management and remediation.
- researched and developed machine learning and AI methodologies for use with vulnerability fingerprinting and prioritization.
- performance tuning and load testing for 3rd party integrations including Qualys, Nexpose, and JIRA.

#### embedded systems

- developed an embedded web server on ARM9 (advanced RISC machine)
- implementation of electronic medical record of patient monitoring database for [redacted]
- built a patient monitoring system using GSM technology for [redacted]
- implemented a theft control system using GPS features on a mobile phone. it uses a mobile phone that was arranged in the vehicle through an interface with an ECM (engine control module) using CAN bus (control area network).
- implementation of RFID technology for a library automation system, it works by identifying persons & books based on the unique tag number & a microcontroller LPC2148 which is of ARM7 structural design.
- designed a GPS & GSM based vehicle tracking system. t vehicle location information can be sent to the mobile remotely using the GSM module. the microcontroller used on the project is 8051.
- designed a special type of round LED display or moving message display with an 8051 microcontroller, LEDs, DC motor, microcontroller, and encoder.

#### software engineering - [(laude technologies)](https://laudetechnologies.com)

- collaborated with a comprehensive team of developers, QA, DBA, Project Managers, and Business units to manage and maintain internally built applications.
- investigated the root cause(s) of software and infrastructure issues and, in some cases, improved the performance of specific applications by over 600%, thereby reducing overall technical debt.
- initiated and executed improvements to code management practices, which greatly enhanced the stability of software releases.
- performed preliminary research on image processing, parallel processing, neural networks, and software metrics for special projects.
- designed sensible “Code First” models to leverage and access data efficiently in the software system.
- performed profiling and optimization on codebase, resulting in 10–1 000x performance improvements (mainly through query optimization and fixing O(n) query problems)
- migrated [redacted] codebase from Javascript to Typescript, fixing and preventing dozens of bugs on the way.
- experienced in performant and secure frontend (Angular, SCSS, Bootstrap, Bulma) and backend (Flask, Pyramid, SQLAlchemy) (web development)

#### other contributions

- implementation of referral program and OTP as a login functionality on YoGO delivery app (backend).
- development of payment processing system and implementation of referral program for YOMoney, a fast-interactive wallet (E-wallet) regulated andd licensed by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).
- built a payroll system using PHP and codeigniter framework for TOEI Animations Phils., one of TOEI Animations Co., Ltd’s subsidiaries.
- built a web hook that handles different endpoints which integrates existing systems for data collection and offer personalization based on geolocation. (Backride Palawan).
