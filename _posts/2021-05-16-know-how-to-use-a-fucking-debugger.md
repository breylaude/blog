I see so many StackOverflow queries where it is evident that the original poster is unaware of the existence of debuggers, let alone how to use one, because they could fix their problem in 5 minutes by placing one break point someplace and inspecting the value of a variable.

I've also seen older programmers advise novices not to rely too heavily on the debugger. 

I believe this is awful advice. 

To someone who does not know how to use a debugger, telling them not to rely on them seems like telling them not to learn how to use one.
