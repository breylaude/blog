 Here is a poem I just read, in English and French, for Pi Day (March 14th)

 ### Pi

Three, One, Four, One, Five, and On <br>
The numbers recount their endless tale. <br>
Three - Barefoot green, a silent voice. <br>
White as hunger, One is twice <br>
Bright like babiesâ€™ eyes. <br>
Four is timid, envious of E. <br>
Five, Punctuation or a pregnant sigh <br>
Precedes proud Nine, color of falling night. <br>
Two, an unfastened knot, <br>
A wayward wind, the hollow of Six resounding. <br>
Nearby, Eight, a cloud of fireflies above a lake <br>
Over which I skim Sevens <br>
Remembering that Zero is nothing but a circle. <br>
