I don’t think all software has this “unique” effect and all hardware isn’t.

There are various things that are well within the competence of humanity, and so could be done just as well by many people. A social media website that is not much different from any other database + html generator. Or a shelf bracket that isn’t much different from any other piece of mass produced stamped sheet steel.

If you are programming a social media app for beekeepers, you aren’t doing any software no one else could do. You may have insights about what beekeepers want that no one else has.

If you are inventing a new quantum resistant crypto algorithm, or doing cutting edge work on AI, that may well be something no one else could do, even if it’s softwareish.

If you are making cutting edge space rockets, or electricity to fuel equipment, maybe no one else could (or would, what you are doing sounds more like its technically easy-ish, but most people wouldn’t know why it was a good idea without all the thinking you did)

If you are making a generic buisness management SAAS, or a generic set of shelves, other people could do a similarly good job. Not that there is anything wrong with that. Most people can’t be the visionaries.
