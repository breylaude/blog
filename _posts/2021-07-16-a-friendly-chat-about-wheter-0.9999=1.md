I stumbled upon a website which talks about something called *hyperreal numbers* and claims that in this theory, the equation `0.999… = 1` is false.

For those who follow the internet, the question of whether `0.999…= 1` has come up a quadbrazillion times on practically every math related forum and even the non-math ones. And every single time it turns into this huge argument with

### Non Mathematicians vs frustrated mathematicians

Neither of them are winning. Some math forums even have strict rules banning users against posting topics that deal with `0.999…= 1`.

But the site I mentioned above actually gives some decent points to support why `0.999… = 1` isn’t necessarily true, but you have to change some of the concepts that we take for granted.

In my opinion, `0.999… and 1` are as equals as can be.
