Ok so I was watching  finance lectures and he gave lectures with a list of kind of like financial advice and he starts out by saying "what is finance", he breaks it down into two things, if you want to get into it you have a choice, you can either invest your own money or other people's money, investing your own money probably only makes sense if you have a lot of it, you need tools to, like there's no reason you should be investing your money if somebody else can invest it better. Basically good advice so I thought I'd do something similar for programming...

I googled "how to learn to program" also again like you think I'm on drugs constantly I'm really not, I smoke weed occasionally, I drink occasionally, I don't really do harder drugs than that, I don't think I've taken adderall or any other stimulants this year, I don't know why I'm always asked on the chat, you all think that maybe there's something defective about my brain chemistry. 

So I'm not going to teach you VIM, if you think you want to learn, I'm just typing here...well, just a lot of times when I do this I'm not trying to be made sense of, honestly, I'm thinking and I'm not trying to explain things such that an audience/viewer will understand, so I could say yeah look, I can tell you "Here's lifehacker.com the best ways to teach yourself to code" and really it comes down to just doing it like almost everything, but I think a question a lot of you have is what exactly do I do, so I'll bring them up here and I'll talk about what a program is.

### Program
Ok so you have a program, what's the definition of a program? You can think about it like this:

{: .box-note}
Input --> Computation --> Output

A program takes in some **Input**, does some **Computation**, and produces some **Output**, so there's an argument to be made that we should be teaching kids how to program; using functional languages, because functional languages more closely match this paradigm... but computers don't operate like functions, computers operate a lot more like turing machines, which we can get into too so maybe on one side of an extreme, we have like a high-level functional programming language like haskell, and then let's not really go lower than C, C and Assembly are the same structurally, so you can treat C and Assembly like the same thing, C is kind of assembly with a bit of syntactic sugar around it. There's nothing in C that doesn't very clearly map to something in Assembly.

Say like *languages* span the gamut from C over to Haskell right? Then you can take languages and languages go in a few directions, you can think of this as like C is like the functional spectrum and then maybe there's C --> Python and this is kind of the *ease* of use spectrum, so in the 90's it was believed that object-oriented programming was going to be this revolution in programming, that's basically C --> C++, and you can take it even further, Microsoft created these things called "com objects" and everything was going to be an object to pass around, small talk has this kind of paradigm also, but it turned out this didn't actually improve programmer productivity, the thing that improved programmer productivity was GC (garbage collection). 

### Computer

So when you think of a computer, first I mean you kinda have to ask the question "What is a computer?" so you can think about it like: 

{: .box-note}
Processor --> (runs stream of instructions)
RAM --> (instructions + data)

So most computers really don't treat these things very differently, when I make a program like `Hello world`:

```c
int main () {
  printf("Hello world\n");
}
```

And I compile this, and take a look on  `objdump -D a.out`  there's the funtion `_start` that calls the `main()`, well it doesn't call the `main()` directly... but it takes `main()` as an argument and it's called a `libc_start_main` from (GLIBC).

```
Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000001050 <_start>:
    1050:       31 ed                   xor    %ebp,%ebp
    1052:       49 89 d1                mov    %rdx,%r9
    1055:       5e                      pop    %rsi
    1056:       48 89 e2                mov    %rsp,%rdx
    1059:       48 83 e4 f0             and    $0xfffffffffffffff0,%rsp
    105d:       50                      push   %rax
    105e:       54                      push   %rsp
    105f:       45 31 c0                xor    %r8d,%r8d
    1062:       31 c9                   xor    %ecx,%ecx
    1064:       48 8d 3d ce 00 00 00    lea    0xce(%rip),%rdi        # 1139 <main>
    106b:       ff 15 4f 2f 00 00       call   *0x2f4f(%rip)        # 3fc0 <__libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.34>
    1071:       f4                      hlt
    1072:       66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00    cs nopw 0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
    1079:       00 00 00 
    107c:       0f 1f 40 00             nopl   0x0(%rax)

```

Also look at `objdump -d simple.out | grep -A12 '<main>:'`, I grepped the `main()` because this is the only function I'm concerned about right now, so there's actually the `Hello world`, so it's in the same memory space as the instructions itself which does the printing of `Hello world`,

![](/assets/img/main.png)

You can look into some syntax and theyâ€™ll make sense in some time. Like `callq 1030 <puts@plt>` is the `printf` function, and of course before calling a function, you need to pass it's arguments on the stack. That means the `mov` just above the `callq` statement is the `Hello world` string (which is the argument passed to `printf()`). 

### Breaking down the program
When you have a program, a program has text, it's called `.text` which is the instructions, a program has a `stack`, has a `heap` and has `bss`. It looks just like this:

{: .box-note}
bss --> static data
heaps --> malloc
stacks --> local vars, control flows 

`bss` are things like static data, there's a stack and then there's a heap, heaps you get to through `malloc`, stacks you get to through anything like local vars also control flows on the stack.


```c
void a() {
  int variable_on_the_stack; //returned by popping off stack
}
```

If I have a main function and I call `a()`

```c
int main() {
  a(); // pushes the return location to stack
}
```

What this does is it pushes the return location to the stack, so you know when I call `b()`

```c
void b(){
}
```

The `variable_on_the_stack` is returned by popping off stack. So this is a basic idea of what a computer is. 

Now there's a whole other direction you can go with the idea of what is programming, there is a practical idea like I want to get a job, so what does this mean? what does a software engineer do? Well **they don't really write algorithms**, you will never in any job have to write a sort algorithm, a binary search algorithm, anything like that as a software engineer.

{: .box-note}
What they do ---> they don't write algorithms

### Practical Programming / Trash Prigramming

What else? Well there are some people who actually work on infrastructure but that's not a lot of people, most software engineers are basically *translators*, and they translate a language, the language is called "business requirements" into code and there's a whole lot of *frameworks* which exist to make writing things that meet business requirements easier. If you think of a business requirement like a web page that's going to allow users to leave a phone number or where we can call them back, there's a lot of frameworks that are designed to do things like that, if you wanted to write something on that you could use something like *Ruby on Rails* for like web apps, there's also this paradigm of CRUD apps and you get what CRUD stands for, the 4 basic types of SQL command; Create, Read, Update, Delete. 

Say we want to build Ruby on Rails or similar for web apps and you're basically creating an app that looks like create, read update, delete. There's some front-end, the view, there's some database which is the *model* and then there is the business logic which is a *controller*, so, say the front-end is a portal where your customers can add their phone number such that you'll be able to call them, they have to be able to update their phone number due to GDPR, they have to be able to delete their profile, you can see how it translates to this.

**This is seriously terrible**. Just the same way the word doctor, doctor means so many things, a doctor is someone who diagnoses, a doctor someone who prescribes, a doctor is someone who has bedside manner, a software engineer like it's kind of misleading and it's almost nothing like what you do in school, if you're in school and you're learning how to write binary search algorithms, it's nothing like what you do in practice, what you do in practice is really you're translating from a really shitty language(business requirements) into these things that are like code and I meet these people and this is what you're going to learn, what you will learn in bootcamps, for example, no one who's ever gone to a bootcamp would ever get a job at Laude Technologies because at Laude Technologies you don't do this trash work, nothing at my company does this stupid paradigm and this is the thing that's going to be replaced pretty soon by by AI's, I think about writing this like if you want to write the low-brow version of backspace, backspace is basically this: *Step 1. Build a CRUD app contracting firm, step 2. Record all the inputs of my contract developers, I don't know just say contract full-time developers (translators), Step 3. Train AI model to translate business logic into code*, so if you are thinking about a job like this you know it's really trash work, you can get paid some amount of money doing it but your monks used to do this, monks used to like spend time copying, they'd have to before they were printing presses, they'd have to, well someone's got to copy the bible so that's practically what you're doing, it's kind of trash.

So notice how none of this *"business requirement" --> code* has anything to do with computers, they're completely separate things. A lot of these people who I meet who are software engineers know basically nothing about computers, what they know about is how to translate this shitty language (business requirements) into "code" (is almost giving it too much credit) and then think of like ruby, react, think of all the very heavy frameworks, it almost has nothing to do with programming, and it's like you're memorizing weird syntax of something stupid. 

### So let's talk about things that are that are more interesting. 

I learned all this from my hacking background, again programs have **Input**, **Computation**, **Output**. If you want to attack the system, say you want to get like remote code execution on the system, the question you ask is *"What input to the system achieves my desired outcome?"* A lot of hacking happens because the system didn't think to check for what it is I'm sending it, and you can get the system to behave in ways that aren't within the normal bounds of output, so if you think this is actually a function. In function you have a domain which is the input to a function, function range or like you know `y = f(x)`. 

This is a pure model, but most computation is impure, when it's impure the function doesn't necessarily have to output something in the range, it can do something entirely different, I mean *"what is hacking?"*, It's figuring out how to to make the function behave, now you can use the same paradigm to analyze almost anything... **input, system, output**, say you want to to change your flight on PhilAir and you don't want to pay change fees, well you can think of the input as *"What can I do? Can I call the PhilAir customer support line* (system --> customer support agent and output --> them clicking a button on their computer that says we've change fees probably written in some CRUD app)", so if you think about it like that, you think *"Ok how do I get to the system?" "What inputs do I have control over, Can I make multiple calls, Can I change the words that I say on each call"*, you can do things that are completely out of bounds of the entire system, you can get the person's real name, you can dox them, you can threaten them, you might go to jail for these things, I'm not advising you do it but it's all within this paradigm of **Input, System, Output**, and that's basically what programming is (Input, Computation, Output).

When I'm actually asked the question "What is programming" / "How do i get good at programming?" I don't understand what it is that they want actually. Any website, any bootcamp will teach you functioning, CRUD app, programming. When it comes down to hacking, every system is different, if you want to get good at hacking you just need to practice this basic idea (Input, system, outpput). 

Remember that one of the reasons I don't play CTFs anymore is because it became too boxed, this is I feel similarly about CP (competition programming). CP is not about who can cleverly come up with new algorithms, it's just about pattern recognition, recognize that this is actually a graph isomorphism problem, I can do graph isomorphism that's np but this is actually a binary search over this and I can sort the list in `n log(n)` instead of n square and I can solve it in time.

CTFs are still fun and I think there's some that kind of probably break the paradigm but a lot of it became the same tricks over and over again and you just drilled, once you can drill it's no longer a test of intelligence, it's a test of willingness to practice or if you're willing to put 40 hours/ week into learning some relatively useful skill. 

I shouldn't hate on CTFs and they're a great way to get into this stuff, it's just a thing back in the day, CTFs didn't feel as much like this but competition programming already did I have nothing but praise for the time that I spent doing competition programming and learning what there is to learn and then realizing once you're just going to be grinding it's time to stop. Hacking and coding is all about learning and applying new skills so repetition runs counter to what it's all about. Ok so 2 days ago where I did the adding the for-loops to clang (that's another you can get paid a lot of money if you can do well) this is kind of what my ethereum contract was. 

Maybe there's a like high-brow software engineering, understand a complex system, modify the system, to say add a feature, ship the new system, meaning like test well and stuff so there's a whole lot of software engineering kind of contracts or jobs that look like this, understand a complex system, modify the system to add a feature, ship the new system. If you make yourself challenges like that clang for-loop challenge, you'll get good at this. You want to be an ML engineer? Well here's the steps to get good at that. Download paper, implement it, keep doing this until you have the skills.

Using the same paradigm. The input,computation, output, well what I need is an input to the system, say my girlfriend, just for example, first can you come up with a definition, an exact definition of "girlfriend", (not the MIT grad youtube maths lecturer). Now the `system = the woman mind` and say the `output = imessage`, saying "so we are official now" so I mean you can think about using the same sort of tricks we used on the PhilAir flight attendant, I'm trying to get the change fees. One thing I've learned studying pickup is you don't get better at seducing women, you just get better at screening women. It's not about convincing women to sleep with you or date you, it's about finding the women who are already interested in sleeping with you or dating you. Same sort of approach and I like to treat this like a funnel. 

### Funnel
This is a classic sales kind of thing, say you want to sell cars, same approach, 1. You have the top of the funnel which is like getting the word out, you can do this with advertising, get some people who visit the dealership, and this is a funnel, of course a thousand people see your ad, say 10,000 people see your ad, 100 people visit the dealership, and say you know 5 by cars, so what's your ratio, here you have 1%, and you have a 5% conversion ratio here, and you're falling off your funnel, so we can do the exact same thing here, 100 message sent to women, we can say maybe 20 replies, let's say 30 replies of every one of those, we'll say we have 5 dates, 2 lays, 1 girlfriend, right, same idea, it's just funnels so this here is a 30% ratio, this is a 1 whatever that is in percent like 18, this is 40 percent and this is 50 funnels. 

### Capitalism
I'm getting money well so the thing about getting money is that there's only one way to get it. This is capitalism, capitalism is based around consent, and this is kind of the beauty of capitalism. In capitalism you have a buyer and you have a seller, and both parties must consent to the transaction, so if you want to make a million dollars, the only way to getting money in a capitalist system is convincing others to give it to you. 

You can't make money, you can't produce your own money, there is one way to get money and that's to convince other people to give it to you. If you have two people and one guy selling an apple and it's ten dollars and the other guy's like I'll give you five dollars for the apple, the seller can now say "Ok, I consent to your five dollars", I don't consent and there's no transaction. 


### Getting money in the capital system

Convince others to give it to you. To answer the question "How do you make 1 million dollar from a product? You can think about who you want to target, you can either make one dollar from one million people, you can get one million dollars from one person and then there's a whole spectrum in the middle. Let's say a thousand dollars from a thousand people and you can think about basically how much effort you're willing to spend on the sale in each case, tons can be spent closing the deal, maybe one phone call, maybe let's say a couple phone calls can be spent closing the deal and this can be online only.

Seriously, how to make a million dollars from a product? Well you can either convince a million people to give you one dollar, you can convince thousand people to give you thousand dollars, or you can convince one person to give you a million dollars. There's no other way to do it, now if you wanna make it look fancy... take a picture, put a lambo on the background and post to instagram, "the new warren buffett".

I mean this stuff is so simple. I don't know how anybody's stupid enough to pay for MBAs that basically like *"here you go there you go"*, there's basically everything you need to know, there's so much complexity and depth, I can sit here and type forever if you wanted to go into the detail of how computers work but nobody seems to care about stuff like that, I don't think that's what people care about, Look, do I know how to do shit like this? Sure if I cared, so fundamentally you have to.

### Instagram
Again, instagram is based around consent, you have follower and an influencer, this is the same, it's the same basic market economics except it's not money, it's clout, it doesn't really matter, but the same basic idea. So how do you get a million subs an insta? convince one million people to subscribe to you, now there's a bunch of ways to do this right? One way to do it is like with appealing content. There's lots of different things you can appeal to; novelty, beauty, sexuality, funny. I mean that's kind of step one and if you don't have appealing content you're not gonna get to the second step, which is be famous. 

This is another way to do it, if you remember my thing yesterday, famous works on a few different levels. You can say there's fomo famous like people who fear "missing out" like *"oh man i gotta follow this guy"*, so you can use fear basically to get people to follow you, there's like the **car crash mentality** which is similar to fear of missing out except you know maybe this is fear of missing something positive/fear of missing something negative, Kanye West is kind of a mix of both, Lindsay Lohan is very much in the car crash mentality. And then there is like dark arts, so you can buy followers, these followers come from a few different places, there's cracked accounts, there's big russian, people who crack accounts, I think there's some new accounts, you can do little psychological tricks like make your insta private, if you make your instagram private, you're appealing to this "what's behind the curtain follow to find out bros"...

### Dynamic programming

I remember a friend asked if I can explain dynamic programming to him. First of, there's youtube, there's plenty of people who make great graphics for what dynamic programming is, the basic idea is say you have some function, you have output f(x,y) and you can figure out how to define f(x,y)  in terms of  f(x) - 1y - 1. Dynamic programming is you build up a table using the previous outputs to influence the next outputs, but again, if you're looking for an exact topic like that there's plenty of videos that'll do a better job explaining it than I can, I don't really know and I'm going to read some comments now and if you keep on asking stupid crap, if you keep on saying "oh i want to learn i want to learn i want to learn" like what is it that you want to learn? Do some garbage collection and explain what malloc is.

### Wasting time
What not to waste your time on? Let's break that down using the same sort of mentality. 

Wasting time, so the girl last night on the date told me she has a very interesting life philosophy... if you know the story about the fox and sour grapes, the fox is out walking, he sees a grape vine and there's a big juicy bundle of grapes sitting up there, he puts his paws up on the fence and he tries to reach it and he can't, he climbs the fence, he starts to climb the fence but he cuts his paw and then he's like *"Yeah okay those grapes are probably sour anyway"* and he walks away. This is the traditional sour grape story and usually people who have this, you know, those angry sort of people, but her take on it was when she cut her paw it must have been a divine sign from god that the grapes were probably poisonous, it's like a positive spin to the sour grape story. 

I don't know, if you go through life, everything that you don't get, you just realize that you didn't want it anyway and you really just put a positive spin on that. This is an impenetrable fortress of psychological, I don't know but wasting time, this gets into existentialism, the basic idea of existentialism is you make your own meaning.

How did people write really long books about it, and you'll have to ask those people but so I don't know, my personal philosophy is that there's no such thing as wasting time. Like it's stupid, wasting time is great, this is the point of time, to waste. Maybe I'll add a caveat to that, don't fall in funnels, if you are in other people's funnels, don't be in skinner boxes, don't fall in funnels, don't be in skinner boxes, and don't be influenced by advertising. 

### What is algorithmic complexity
Algorithmic complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm would take to complete given input of size n, if an algorithm has to scale it should compute the result with a finite and practical time bound even for large values of n, for this reason complexity is calculated asymptotically as n approaches infinity, that's what big o notation is, 

This is a way of thinking about it. How many operations does it take for an input of size n? So you can take sorting algorithms, sorting is usually a good way to think about complexity, so you can take a bubble sort algorithm. Bubble sort in pseudocode is something along the lines of:

```c
for i in 1..n:
  for j in i+1..n:
    if j < i:
      swap arr[i] and arr[j]
```

This algorithm is `o(n^2)` because you see this loop start from zero, this loop is n this loop you can be like well no the average is actually n over two but you know n times n over two is is is uh you know it's still o of n squared right so this is an o of n squared sorting algorithm so you can take other sorting algorithms other sorting algorithms basically have this idea of we're going to build up a tree so say i want to sort the list you know three five four six right um we take a tree we put seven on the top branch right and now we say three is three uh less than or equal to seven uh it's less than so we'll put it on this side of the tree okay and now we do the same thing with four so we say well okay let's take four four less than or equal to seven it's less than seven less than or equal to three it's it's greater than three so it goes here right um six we have the same kind of well this turned out to not work too well uh because the height of this tree is n but let's say i added something like 10 in you know 10 would go here in the tree and make my tree too nice uh let's say i added a five in right the five would go here in the tree and the size of this tree the height of this tree uh is login right um so that's all the sort algorithms that are in n log n time uh basically have some variant of this right so it's it's it's n inserts into a login sized tree so there are actually sorting algorithms that run in o n ah so we can think about let's say the list that i'm sorting is only um is guaranteed to only be numbers between one and one hundred so i can create a maybe something like hash sort or something uh i don't know what the name of it is but oh then sort so i can create an array like count sub 100 for i and 0 to n count sub arr sub i plus equals one right and then i can loop through count and then i say uh for well you know just like print um you want to print out basically the like like the number uh count number of times right um so you see how this is of m i have one loop going to n and then i have one loop going to to to count which can be viewed as like uh as like a k and k is small uh but this obviously only works if your your total number here is small uh because the k if these biggest element in the array were to grow um with the length of the array then the sort would not be o of n but assuming that it stays at 100 uh this sword is always of n but usually the smallest sort is ammon i think maybe that explains it better than this no we're not solving any leap codes um i'd like to see you improve and open source system that you'd like to see improve and follow along as you help progressing issues and features people don't want to learn they want to have your skills yeah they can get fucked can i explain binary search time complexity sure so binary search find an element in a sorted list something i say is hacking a lot of times is uh is just binary search by hand right um so let's say let's say let's say you have an oracle uh or or you know we'll just we'll just do it straight up right uh so here's the sorted list right um let's make all right let's say i want to find 67 right um so b search 67. so you start out with defining a uh a a a low and a high uh so we'll make the low uh the beginning of the array and the high the length of the array so i now take the midpoint let's say i look at the array array submit is 22. now i know that it can't possibly be any of these right so here's my pivot i say it can't possibly be any of these because 67 is greater than 22 so we can now say low equals mid so now i'm just looking at this array here so that's the first run of binary search right um so again low zero highest length of array mid low plus high equals two let's say mid is one uh so we get 45 low equals mid all right so now now we're doing it again uh for this uh and this time mid is 67 all right run it through so we can return that we can figure out what the index uh in the original array was right um so notice that this took three steps which is significantly less than here n equals 7 because 7 is the length of the array so binary search runs an o of log n time again you can think about it similar to the tree where you're only walking down one path instead let's say instead of this sorted list being put contiguously it's a tree how many jumps you're going to have to take in the tree it's login what paper can implement beginner ml engineer well i mean that's a deep what paper can implement a beginning ml engineer oh i don't know about that uh yeah data science is largely bs anyone who's teaching you if you're ever learning a like an object level skill you're probably not learning the right thing object level skills will die out when the tools die out but if you're learning kind of meta-level skills then they're never going to it's like truth about the world right um are you learning something from nature or are you learning something from people right if you're learning something from nature good uh if you're learning something from people bad right um so you can you can you can break pretty much everything down into into this paradigm if you're learning like physics comes from nature learning physics is good if you're learning celebrity gossip this is just arbitrary bullshit about people it's bad um so you know one of the one of the founding themes for the college uh so we reject uh power over people um and this will actually make us ignored by the system a system cares deeply about power over people embrace power over nature so yeah um and then like like like okay so like answering a question what is data science right um if data science if data science means like statistics sure if data science means like um tooling used at company x no let's define f by for complex s with a positive real part how do i find all zeros of the function that looks oddly like the riemann hypothesis um my most of my math knowledge is in discrete math i don't know that much [Music] calculus i didn't really know how to do that i mean i could write a simulator for that uh and then we can binary search for zeros assuming the function's continuous we can't exactly binary search uh well those things are going to get smaller too complex s with positive real part oh god i gotta do complex numbers too i don't really know um we want to learn how to learn efficiently learning strategies i don't know helm.ai is four years behind some of these questions like what books do you recommend how to stay hungry um elon talks about this a lot right so you want to build a uh a knowledge tree right i build a knowledge tree and that means that whenever you learn new information fits into the trade people who i've met who know a lot of things it's not even always that they know um maybe uh interpolation is possible even if you don't know exactly what's a note of a tree if you have some nodes nearby you can kind of interpolate to it right um yeah so it's kind of a framework for understanding um you can you can root this knowledge tree so elon talks about it elon roots knowledge tree in physics i root knowledge tree in information all right so my whole input computation output is this this idea of um information this is a modernist perspective post-modernist perspective all right um but but both of those things are are very very good ways of understanding uh so so i mean how to explain uh anything i mean you know i some of these were like how to get a girlfriend right input system output this is my core paradigm for understanding anything this is what richard hamming was promoted a lot that's that's like like like a hamming tree guy coding theory was one of the classes i took that i couldn't do it was too hard for me um i haven't seen so bezos um bezos basically uses this this this one trick um bazel's operations mastermind right [Music] so for example um amazon ships many packages uh when amazon negotiates with ups uh bezos has his guys draw up a amazon shipping plan right the plan is uh let's say sales pitch uh to ups ups um you know uh gives real rate right great pezos wins and that's that's that is the amazon trick over and over and over again uh oh post-structuralism see i like weird things like this i really i really want to meet more i really want to meet more women and and go on more dates like women who like study this stuff you know like like like i met this i have this dave this one girl at birthday and she like knew about all this stuff man it's it's a whole world it's a whole world and i try my best to understand it i feel like i'll always kind of be a tourist there um structuralism proposes that one may understand human culture by means of a structure modeled on language uh this understanding differs from concrete reality and abstraction ideas instead as a third order that mediates between the two yeah and then what's downstream of all this is the is the is the modern trash yeah the postmodernists were trolls man that's i was i was on the phone with my friend last night and i was like you know what i'm a postmodernist like i really i embrace these these i hold these truths to be self-evident um yeah yeah bourgeoisie for cow and they're trolls but they're trolls who've shaped the modern world one thing that i wish i'd done differently when i was younger was actually i didn't i rejected almost outright the humanities um as being any uh oh they were trolls people just took them seriously i mean they admitted as such i rejected the humanities is any sort of uh any sort of source of relevance in my life um when as i've grown up i've come to realize that the college and the singularity the science doesn't matter i i think one of the greatest tragedies in history was that these incredibly intelligent scientists built a nuclear bomb and then handed that bomb off to politicians like they're subservient to them what why why why is this why do politicians or those kind of people have this power um so something that is changing uh throughout history is power over people um used to be all used to be everything all right um if you if you you didn't if you lived in a tribe right if you lived in a like a hunter-gatherer or tribe um the only thing what what made you alpha chimp what made you alpha chimp was was having power over the other uh the other chimps uh not having power over nature you aren't a 10x better hunter there are there were no 10x better hunters um but power over people uh is waning and power over nature uh is waxing is the right word no i don't want top 10 best waxing salons what i got waxing like a moon yeah having increasing its apparent size i dropped out of philosophy undergraduate because i realized how much you were just learning to tell logically sound stories to each other about how the world is i wish i wish there were a place where i could go to learn real humanities it seems like being self-taught in the humanities is more difficult um i found a few you come upon a few texts in there and there and they're kind of mind-blowing um start what is literature uh yeah you should read this ah i'm reading that was kind of the first when i started to realize that that there was a huge path to uh what is what is what is running a company what is what is being uh what is being ceo it's just telling stories all you're doing is telling stories and we compete uh the world is a big competition of these stories what is the wickensteiner's tiring debate i have so much to read i don't know and i guess this is a lot of what i've been doing off stream especially now is is just it's just reading and i'm not there's no there's no future in hacking um there's practically no future in programming it's not a question of if the singularity is going to happen it's a question of when and what will it look like and it seems like what it will look like will be a lot less shaped by programmers doing the grunt work and a lot more shaped by who's telling the best stories so you know if you want to save the world better learn how to tell stories please teach me on becoming an expert in programming so wait hang on what's the central kind of thesis of um by the way everybody should read uh should read turns paper ramsay wow it's all the same people man these people are everywhere so all biologists want to be chemists all chemists want to be physicists while physicists want to be mathematicians all mathematicians want to be philosophers and all philosophers want to be employed um programmers are are translators yeah uh right this is this is what most software engineers do all day um go learn your stupid frameworks right but again that's the my same thing about about data science right um you know tooling that will go out of vogue no out of vote maybe that's right maybe that's wrong uh yeah i met my medic there uh these basic ideas peter t i read some new peter kill thing he really went hard on that do i think today we have less revolutionary innovative minds in general than before no how many people can you name from the 20th century like a hundred wait there's there's there's definitely revolutionary people around today i i think i think that who's the most revolutionary person i think of the current millennium satoshi nakamoto if you really want to do things in some way you got to do them anonymously ah i mean that that's just i don't know maybe that's not true but yeah i mean look at look at what elon musk is doing right there there are definitely people who are alive today who are going to be remembered in 100 years i read the annotated turing book yeah yeah that's why i read the paper uh i'll i'll show for the book yeah i recommend that book what is a good work ethic to have so one test that i like to use often to ask a question if somebody's saying something say would anybody ever say the opposite right so if you have a politician who stands up on stage and says the children are our future i care about the children they're not really saying anything because nobody would ever say the opposite so what is a good work ethic to have i mean it's a meaningless question because the like you should slack off a lot and you know not really pay attention do things sloppily yeah said nobody ever i'm showing for myself man i'm satoshi uh what's unless wrong i'm not saying you should do anything um it's just a framework it's a framework for thinking no i see i'm not i'm not i'm really not interested in answering questions about myself why do you care i'm nobody who are you you're nobody too oh they're coming after me man oh no locker doors man i don't know like it's again people are boring nature's interesting i'm a people too i'm pretty boring have to think about recursion just as a stack all right swat on my house oh no this guy's going to call a swat in my house no he's not he's banned crud development will go away yeah but it will just become current development will become the most lowest common denominator ai shit you know who's that guy in office space he's like well i take the thing from the engineers and i give it to the i talk to the customer and i give it to the engineers right that's all it's going to be um constructivist mathematics uh i'm i'm yeah of course uh so my understanding of constructivism uh says that you can't the law of the excluded middle doesn't apply uh so you can't just make an assumption find a contradiction and say therefore the assumption is true uh you wouldn't this is why i really like things like cock which like so they have a constructivist cock which um it says if you want to say something's true you can't just say you can't just like yeah find a contradiction uh so i think that like finitism i believe is true in a deep philosophical sense um whereas constructivism is just another lens uh where are the differences what can you not what can you say in non-constructivist mathematics uh that you can't say in constructivist or just proofs harder taking the principle of the excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same say as prescribing the telescope to an astronomer or the box of the use of his fists um yeah so so yeah ah construct is google gonna actually give me anything for this i want non-constructivist truths you can't derive in constructivism oh i'll say oh god yeah aaron schwartz take down j store fuck j store some like learning theory i don't know about that yeah what i want to know is like like yeah what are the truths right and then do they feel i don't know i mean i like like intuitionism as well um it's one thing to innovate in the computer science world but it's another thing to utilize it to make money which is where you need translators to deliver uh so uh what is money right all uh i mean okay uh [Music] it gets i'm not gonna go into this but if your goal in life is to make money all i will say is that is never for anybody a terminal goal making money cannot be a terminal goal right money money itself does not have any intrinsic value money only has always think about what your terminal values are right um this is uh let's find the slate star codex society shocks uh yes bostrom makes an offhanded reference of the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia one that every single citizen including the leadership hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered it's easy enough to imagine such a state imagine a country with two rules first every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves strong electric shocks second if anyone fails to follow a rule including this one or speaks out against there fails to enforce it all citizens must unite to kill that person suppose these rules were well enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced so you shock yourself for eight hours a day because you know if you don't everyone else will kill you because if they don't everyone else will kill them and so on i heard the russians used a similar tactic in order to prevent defection in world war ii uh you know a soldier on the front line who's being told to charge a machine gun turret might want to run the other way but you know it is the job of everybody behind them to shoot all the cowards and if you do not shoot a coward you're a coward yourself and you'll be shot by somebody else dictatorless dystopia so think about what you really want money for and are we really just in one of these dictators dystopias there's my viewer count he's gone and coward is whatever is defined by the russian system right are we running out of innovative ideas no oh here we go easy example of a non-constructivist proof without an obvious fix some digit occurs infinitely often in the decimal expansion of pi have we proven that oh some digit occurs okay perhaps you think of the statement that every digit occurs infinitely often which is probably open yeah um but some digit occurs infinitely often uh i mean yeah okay you're right so the obvious proof there is assume for the sake of contradiction that no digits occur infinitely often then given that there's a finite number of digits uh by the pigeonhole principle pi is not a transcendent number but we know pi is a transcendent number uh therefore contradiction uh qed um this is another classic one yeah i mean but i'm sure you can prove that uh the square root of two's irrational uh i'm sure you can prove that in a constraint constructivist proof square root to uh irrational direct proof of irrationality a simple direct proof that i found as a teenager theorem it can conduct our ideal what that's confusing okay theorem is that it's integral if rational so meaning it's an integer if it's if it's rational uh the proof okay so it's a reduced fraction so the greatest common divisor is one uh that's using like the extended euclidean algorithm yeah that works sure yeah there you go it's so much better it's so much better than the other proof oh browering can are examples let's say i think that all of higher education today is whatever the opposite of based is you know maybe cupped uh that's kind of a problem like there's probably small numbers of holdouts in these tentacles institutions uh rise of administration costs in colleges uh yeah all right there we go it's it's there uh put it this way administrative spending comprised just 26 percent of total educational spending by american colleges uh three decades later admitted no it's not wait huh where'd the other spending go i don't know ah maybe this isn't true i'm not i'm not that interested in looking into the case uh i mean i witnessed this firsthand i've heard from speaking with a lot of people uh just how this is what i mean uh that's that's not what i was thinking of but yeah i'm not i'm not i'm not hopeful for the future of the the higher education system uh curtis describes it as a state church where do i expect newer generations to learn things like lower level programming or theory the same place everyone else did what do you mean people always say this people say this about computer science man the kids aren't really going to learn how computers work why because our math majors don't know how arithmetic works like that's just a sign that someone was poorly educated not it's not going to like fade from the world people say this but you know there's been so many other disciplines and i have no idea why they think computer science is going to be different look up the journal constructive approximation there's so much to learn guys i don't really know what approximations and expansions are by the way oh i mean unfortunately it's a web archive but can we look at how nice this web page is someone criticized my uh use of like looking at the sh the form and not the content but the form is an incredibly good predictor of content a website like this contains truths because there's no other reason for someone to build it unfortunately it's been taken offline let's see a website like this probably contains way less truths right compare the websites so now we see what's wrong with uh colleges i promise our university will have a website that looks much more like this and much less like this computer architecture or quantitative approach let's see what we got college is a funnel society's a funnel man what i want to show me the uh don't show me the table of contents he's the president of stanford i tried yeah i click off the kindle version i i think i don't think anywhere ah take a look inside oh cool see what we got i mean this is yeah if you want to study computer architecture that's like a decent oh now this is i mean this is from google what takes like uh 10 nanoseconds to get to uh l1 cache 100 nanoseconds to get to l2 takes like a microsecond to get to memory and it takes like a millisecond to get to disk or whatever those numbers are you should know that understand all of that memory hierarchy there's an old saying like there's two hard problems in computer science it's like search and caching or something um that's the quote cash and validation and naming things know that you are problems in computer science cash and validation naming things and off by one errors let's see cool how do you get over a thousand people to watch you rant about how you they shouldn't need to watch people like you rant i don't know we're just hanging out and like thinking i'm gonna go back to reading in a bit i try my ideas out on twitch right i tried hammer out and decided there's never gonna be a hammer fuck hammer um i tried backspace out and it got a pretty good response on twitch um the problems with backspace are more technical and actually comes down to more the question of what is programming right i don't want to make if you want to do programming for work if you want to make crud apps like that's not really what i want to do in backspace um i mean the the problem i ran into with backspace is like um is our modern programming languages already the best way to describe what you want how yeah like yeah what is it is programming really just describing is is there a more concise language that's probably a better way to is does there exist a more concise programming language um aka uh what is the next gc right object-oriented programming didn't deliver the improvements garbage collection did uh not having to deal with freeing your memory um i mean so so my basic thesis is like uh compilers should do more search gc is garbage collection uh so if i write some if i write some c code let's make a function all right so that's all well and good except for this fact see look at a dot out's memory usage right it's memory usage is growing and we're going to have to kill it before it keeps using more because there's a memory leak because what happens in this program is every time a is called i'm malicking six bytes of memory i'm taking six bytes off the heap and even though once this while loop comes around again those bytes are never accessible um it doesn't matter the compiler the program's already allocated them so you know to fix this bug i can do that and now we'll see that a dot out does not increase in memory usage right so a gc would automatically find unreachable pointers and free them yeah so rust has a separate idea russ has this idea of of uh of ownership um but it makes rust very very hard to code the the beauty of gcs is that they operate completely in the background and it would make this a valid program to run i could write this in go and go as a gc and it's fine if you can find the shortest program that outputs the data yeah sure um i shall for the hudder prize a lot make it subscribers only you never see my chat i see your chat and you're a subscriber um all right we'll be right back and then we'll do we'll do subscriber only q a and then go back to reading what problems are we solving today no real problems shining like a diamond what are you reading from i'm almost done with my uh my book from yesterday white noise what is this dud baiting twitch prime dot can we do a meet up before the singularity what happens if you pass string copy a character array without a null terminator um i mean it'll just keep copying to whatever on the stack till it finds it i'll terminator is it any indication that we're not close to an efficient to write language when we have functional programming that's so fundamentally different i mean um are getting better i i'm very oh man you know what i'd give to code in the language 20 years from now oh i'd be so happy cameo.com what was that i was just like i can book like famous people to come to my party look at personalized messages wow oh i got to think about my brand you know and how to solve constant growth of misinformation i mean has that ratio actually gotten worse has the ratio of information to misinformation changed i'm not sure it has how does one be motivated oh this is dumb questions like think of why that's a dumb question what are you one one way to ask if if something's a dumb question or not is like think about what the structure of the answer you want is what kind of structure like like like what is the space what does the range look like of the what does the output space look like like you are the kind of person who deserves google right because this one weird trick to stay motivated is is what you're looking for there and that's the only answer you're going to get and it's not a real answer so your curiosity is never going to be satiated and you're going to keep googling that same crap over and over and over again there's not an answer there's less hierarchy and information distribution i'm not even sure about that so think about in some ways there's more hierarchy right um oh that's all right let me see if i can find i wish i had a nice way to index this book better um about families let's find the exact quote they put in the book a lot better i'm gonna say it but families are held together based on in um on untruths and and commonly shared lies i think that despite people talking a lot about misinformation in in some ways from my perspective when people are screaming about fake news what they're actually mad about when they keep talking about misinformation is actually that they don't control the narrative anymore it's not that the new narratives are any less true than the old narratives the old narratives are all lies as well it's just there's a different kind of group providing the new narratives the new narratives are coming from a different place and i think there is slightly more true than the old narratives but only slightly any advice to crack fang interviews all right honestly if they sit you down and they're like do two lead code hard problems this is why i'm not doing lead code on stream for you guys it's like why waste your time memorizing that they're no it's just insulting i mean i think it's insulting to to everybody uh who's being interviewed like they're not checking to see whether you're a good programmer or not they're checking to see whether you're willing to grind for hours and hours and hours right delete code grind is real like is that is that the kind of organization you want to go work at an organization that values you just grinding on something stupid and irrelevant for hours um that said i think that uh programming challenges are an incredible way to judge um candidates but not timed ones right we have a like or at least not time crunch in front of a person uh we we have a we have a hackering challenge for for comma um but we give you four hours and if you're good you can do it in under an hour it's it's not designed to be it's designed to be a freshman weeder test not some insane this is how we're truly going to judge you the speed challenge yeah i like the speed challenge it's kind of it's more open-ended but it has it's it's more open-ended but it has a clear rigid evaluation criteria uh it's an import it's important to have interviews that are have clear evaluation criteria to avoid bias don't take amphetamines um so my experience with uh amphetamines adderall stimulants is they do not make you better at things they make you think you're better at things they they trigger this delusion uh if i am good at something i want to believe i am good at something if i am bad at something i want to believe i am bad at something nootropics are mostly a scam i think humanities will ever be able to escape structures and hierarchies within nature that combat transhumanism i'm not sure exactly what that means honesty doesn't give deep thoughts it makes you think all your thoughts are deep i have more positive things to say about lsd than i do about uh amphetamines i think lsd shows you something and uh i mean like with all drugs you know understand what it has to teach you and then stop i think i want to go to one of those 10-day meditation retreats uh but i don't know i don't want to talk about drugs they're not drugs aren't that interesting joshua new god of transhumanism uh what's the happiest memory i don't really like talking about myself either most of these things here i don't really talk about myself i do give anecdotes for my wife they're they're more to illustrate a point uh because anything that i say about myself is personal and useless to you don't be like me it's dumb you know i'm trying to give you information so you can think don dele white noise some of the stories are made up yeah doesn't matter uh i've been drinking recess yeah it's kind of nice i've never read your class elements all right cool um it's about pascal's wager pascal's mugging yeah heh it's a funny idea and this is why i'm not a consequentialist many mangoes that is kind of funny things by oh oh you mean just things in general oh i felt like things was like uh yeah of course web app frameworks like electron why don't we ship the operating system in every uh electron is just docker man it's the same idea no i don't want i don't know anything that makes deployment development easier is probably good stanislaw lim can you think of any fun problems to tackle in your retails if you come up with one hmm no it is it's in local folder i'm probably much more likely to lose it than the cloud the fuck is a tc if you want a high tc you gotta play the game you know what there is a star trek voyager episode tc yes treatment coefficient yes yes critical care yes just as the doctor asks what tc stands for oh total compensation oh you mean the team blinds oh my god oh my god it's pascal's mugging man yeah i'd like to go to today the problem is i have to like schedule it months in advance worldsignia yt thank you for subscribing turning into a lizard man i love voyager growing up you know i just want to know where i learned morality from star trek voyager so whatever janeway believed that i believe alright guys thank you for watching the stream um if you enjoyed today's stream i'm gonna look at my revenues and if i got a lot of revenue for this stream we're gonna do more streams like this one but i don't know i'm probably not gonna stream for a bit it's the weekend i got things to do that aren't streaming uh please subscribe if you haven't subscribed it we like subscribers somebody asked me earlier do i believe that there are some people are better than others yes i believe that subscribers are better than non-subscribers rex doors thank you for subscribing can you do an irl stream should i like rent out a you know you know like they're hyped on the covet shit um feels good man subs rise up yeah there's a class system all twitches aren't equal they're subscribers and non-subscribers i don't i don't tell lies you know i'm a flex thank you for gifting subs um today's dream is top tier i'm glad you liked it yeah just get a mask or something with my mask that's right let's show it boys today's flow is better thank you what's ocsp oh just some like certification thing vic jack thank you for subscribing uh facetime is still funny um subscriber power full lidar you take care too real port your subscriber your good person um yeah not have any certifications don't don't take me over security itself is all it's all racket first we got to scare them about hackers then we got to sell them the anecdote to hackers antidote yeah thank you uh ranch leo thank you for subscribing there's a take on morality of piracy i don't believe in universal morality or ethics make up your own mind man um anybody who's trying to but i do dislike anybody who tries to preach to you morality or ethics tries to tell you how you should act man because that's just powerful people moral relativist i have personal borrows i talk about yeah like i said i don't really like talking about my only streams i don't really think i talk about like myself right like even this this is not really a comment about myself this is a comment about the content of the streams i post more instagram pics all right well you know what if i find out about this shit we're never streaming again you're banned and you know what people dm me all the time my dms are full of can you please unban me yo dude can you unban me sir yo can you unban me bro you're banned for life i don't think jaime was a more relative of a style that's true can i ban you i'm not gonna ban you you're a subscriber you're a good person uh good i'm glad if ro jogen was like a mockery of the podcast i would totally go on road joking like a mockery of that whole format rojo again yo is there really a road joking let's check it out ro jogen um laser cap boss you're close to getting banned you don't care if you're a subscriber bro jogin there's nothing wrong with the format it has more to do with the reach this is why i wouldn't go on joe rogan i just imagined saris wasn't that the bad guy in galaxy quest alright guys thank you all for watching good afternoon learn real things
