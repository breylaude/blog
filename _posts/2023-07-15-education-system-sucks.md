I'll be finally sharing my take about the corruption, nonsensical grading system, and the absurd reality that is Philippine education. 

{: .box-note}
Hold on to your textbook (if you can find one)

### First and foremost

**Attendance**

Ah, attendance – *the ultimate determinant of your academic prowess.* 

Who needs exams when you can master the art of sitting in a chair for a predetermined number of hours? In this educational saga, attending class religiously is akin to holding the philosopher's stone; it magically transforms you into a scholar. 

It's almost as if the government believes that absorbing knowledge is directly proportional to the amount of time your butt occupies a seat. **Logic? What's that?**

### Where brilliance die

Exams, the supposed battlegrounds of intellect, have been reduced to mere rituals. 

Forget about understanding complex theories or solving intricate problems; *this is the land of regurgitation*. Memorize, spit it out during the exam, forget it immediately afterward – the holy trinity of Philippine exam-taking. 

In this topsy-turvy world, critical thinking is a rare unicorn, and creative answers are as welcome as a porcupine in a balloon factory.

### Grading system: a masterpiece of absurdity

Let's talk about the grading system, shall we? 

In a universe where common sense is a scarce resource, grades are bestowed not on merit but on your ability to occupy a seat consistently. 

A student who attends religiously but lacks a basic understanding of the subject matter is celebrated, while the one who aces exams but misses a class or two might as well be invisible. It's a numerical nightmare where attendance trumps aptitude, and students are left scratching their heads in disbelief.

### Lurking in the shadows

Behind the scenes, corruption in the education system thrives like mushrooms in a damp cellar. 

Funds disappear into the pockets of bureaucrats faster than you can say "transparency," leaving schools crumbling and students stranded without essential resources. 

It's almost as if someone whispered in the ears of officials, convincing them that stealing from education is a victimless crime.

Spoiler alert: it's not.

### Fin 

And there you have it, a glimpse of my outlook throughout the trash that is the Philippines' education system – where attendance reigns supreme, exams are a formality, and corruption lurks like a shadow overlord.
