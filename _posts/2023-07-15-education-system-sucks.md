Hold on to your textbook (if you can find one)

### Ah, attendance – *the ultimate determinant of your academic prowess.* 

attendance – the golden ticket to academic success in this crazy land. It's as if the education system believes that the more hours you spend warming the chair, the smarter you magically become. Never mind if you're half-asleep or doodling galaxies in your notebook; as long as you're present, you're on the right path to enlightenment. Who knew that mastering the art of breathing in a classroom could be so vital?

It's almost as if the government believes that absorbing knowledge is directly proportional to the amount of time your butt occupies a seat. **Logic? What's that?**

### Where real challenge begin

Exams, the supposed battleground where gaining knowledge meets challenge, are rendered nearly meaningless. In this surreal realm, it's not about understanding complex theories or demonstrating problem-solving skills; it's about memorizing facts like a parrot and regurgitating them on demand. 

Critical thinking? Creativity? Nope, those are as welcome as a porcupine in a balloon shop. It's a race to see who can memorize the most, not who can comprehend the best.

### Grades = absurdity = true form 

The grading system here is like a Picasso painting – a masterpiece of confusion. Your grades aren't a reflection of your understanding or skills; they're more like a lottery. A student who nods off during lectures but never misses a class might outshine the one who aces every test but dared to have a sick day. It's almost poetic how attendance, not actual knowledge, is the currency of success here.

### The irony

Of course, is that while attendance records bask in the limelight, actual learning often takes a backseat. It's as if the system believes that physically being in class somehow imparts knowledge by osmosis. 

Little do they realize that education requires active engagement, participation, and genuine understanding, not just a pulse and a pen to sign the sheet.

### Lurking in the shadows

Behind the scenes, corruption in the education system thrives like mushrooms in a damp cellar. 

Funds disappear into the pockets of bureaucrats faster than you can say "transparency," leaving schools crumbling and students stranded without essential resources. 

It's almost as if someone whispered in the ears of officials, convincing them that stealing from education is a victimless crime.

Spoiler alert: it's not.

### Fin 

And there you have it, a glimpse of my outlook throughout the trash that is the Philippines' education system – where attendance reigns supreme, exams are a formality, and corruption lurks like a shadow overlord.
