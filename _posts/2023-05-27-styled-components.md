This current trend in the web development industry, is probably familiar to you. 

*But pardon my skepticism*, because I can’t help but wonder, is it really THAT groundbreaking?

The core idea behind *Styled Components* is to remove the ‘cascade’ from CSS. 

And I know, cascading styles can be a headache. But, does eradicating this cascade lead to better, more maintainable designs? 

Fucking color me skeptical.
