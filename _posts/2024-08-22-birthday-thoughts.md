It's my birthday today, although it doesn't feel like it. But better than any material presents I would want is that I figure writing what I really think about right now which is something I might forget about soon.

Wasting time, so my girlfriend told me she has a very interesting life philosophy, she told me a story about the fox and the sour grapes. 

The fox is out walking, he sees a grape vine and there’s a big juicy bundle of grapes sitting up there, he puts his paws up on the fence and he tries to reach it and he can’t, he climbs the fence, he starts to climb the fence but he cuts his paw and then he’s like “Yeah ok those grapes are probably sour anyway” and he walks away. This is the traditional sour grape story and usually people who have this, you know, those angry sort of people, but her take on it was when she cut her paw it must have been a divine sign from god that the grapes were probably poisonous, it’s like a positive spin to the sour grape story.

I'm not sure, but as you go through life, everything you don't get, you realize you didn't want it in the first place, and you just put a positive spin on it. This is an impenetrable fortress of psychological junk, I'm not sure, but wasting time, this gets into existentialism, because the core idea of existentialism is that you create your own meaning.

Just think about how people write really big books about it, and you’ll have to ask those people, but I'm not sure, my personal opinion is that there’s no such thing as wasting time. Like it’s stupid, wasting time is great, this is the point of time, to waste. Maybe I’ll add a caveat to that, don’t fall in funnels, if you are in other people’s funnels, don’t be in skinner boxes, and don’t be influenced by advertising.
