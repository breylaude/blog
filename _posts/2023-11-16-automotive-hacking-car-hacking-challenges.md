###  Emerging hurdles with connected cars

Stuff like **vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)** and **vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)** communications is catching on, and I bet they'll bring a bunch of perks for us, the carmakers, and even the public infrastructure management. In the future, your car might get updates **over the air (OTA)**, just like your smartphone does now. It's like a high-tech tune-up that can boost what's already there or toss in some new features.

When diving into new tech like this, we've got to lock down the security right from the get-go. Every shiny innovation brings with it a chance for trouble, so it's crucial to build in solid security controls from the very beginning. Take wireless key fobs, for instance â€“ these days, cloning attacks are on the rise. Until the car guys work out the kinks in security, maybe it's a good move to stash those key fobs in a bag that zaps RFID signals. Better safe than sorry.
