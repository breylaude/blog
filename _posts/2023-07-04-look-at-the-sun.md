There are a lot of conventionally attractive women around, and the majority of them doesn't appeal to me.

These are not syrup, these are not jund, these are blinding people.

### People
People are odd creatures. I will admit I do not understand them, regardless of how I try.

Each person is flawed beyond measure, weâ€™re flawed in ways we don't even realise we can be flawed in.

I appreciate people who accept this fact.

What I don't like are the people that try to hide it. The faces of the world, the celebrities.

### Girls
These are the people you see at the types of parties you don't really get invited to. These are the people that told you that you're a weirdo in highschool, and these are the people you grew up hearing *thats the sort of girl you want* time and time again.

These people are suns, blinding suns that burn so bright and want the world to know it and my eyes cannot handle the intensity.

Give me a moon, give me an asteroid, give me a nebula. Give me a blackhole, give me a space rock.

Give me void.

Give me anything, but don't make me stare at the sun.

Because after all...

*"Rainy days are much more fun."*
