There are a lot of conventionally attractive women in the city, and the majority of them didn't appeal to me.

{: .box-note}
DISCLAIMER: This applies to non-women also but they’re not the focus of this rant

These are not syrup, these are not jund, these are blinding people.

### Humans
Humans are odd creatures. I will admit I do not understand them, regardless of how I try.

Each human is flawed beyond measure, we’re flawed in ways we don't even realise we can be flawed in.

I appreciate people who accept this fact.

What I don't like are the people that try to hide it. The faces of the world, the celebrities.

### Girls
These are the ladies you see at the types of parties you don't really get invited to. These are the women that told you that you're a weirdo in highschool, and these are the women you grew up hearing *thats the sort of girl you want* time and time again.

These women are suns, blinding suns that burn so bright and want the world to know it.

My eyes cannot handle the intensity.

Give me a moon, give me an asteroid, give me a nebula.

Give me a black hole, give me a space rock.

Give me a void.

Give me anything, but don't make me stare at the sun.

Because after all….
