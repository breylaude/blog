If you're a hoopy frood who always knows where their headphones are, then you're ready to venture out into the big terrible world and interact with some strangers **"interact" with some strangers!**

### Noggin' telecommunicators

Everyone should own a pair of really nice and comfy headphones, the more wires the better because as we all know

> Wires in fashion are cyb as hell ~ <span style="color:red">gucci or someone, Idk</span>

There was a time in my life where I wore the cheapest ear buds I could find and listened to music I ripped off of youtube or found on limewire through a barrage of Bill Clintons telling me he did not have sexual intercourse with that woman, but he did get tons of free tech soykaf from some website.

Nowadays we’ve got only the most freedom respecting flacs, a neato pocket amp, and some nice sennys to pad everything out.

living the dream.

### People who don't care

There's something very calming about not caring too much in life (I'm not, but I know someone very close to me), about being someone on the outside, away from the centre of attention, and being able to go about their day without having to involve anyone else unless they want to.

Headphones are beautiful because you can turn those fuckers up very loud and basically drown out not only everyone, but the sound of the cars and your footsteps and anything else you need to not think about.

You don't even have to have them extremely loud, if you just have them on that's enough to get people to leave you alone, PLUS, if you're a cool hacker type you can even listen to people's conversations when they think you can't hear and pull off hacks and feel like a god doing nothing with that info but enjoy the fantasy nonetheless.

### Music

and to top it all off, music really is a modern day form of magick.

if you can get into this `$(postTitle)`, or perhaps you’d call it a headphone bubble since its easier to say and doesnt require you to verbate non-alphabet characters, then youre actually up to the hardest task yet.

actually choosing what music to listen to

it will affect your entire day, every decision you make will be influenced by the music you chose to listen to that morning.

you can change your world for the better, or worse, or whatever you decide, as long as you choose the correct music, your mindset will be affected, which will affect the wider world through its actions, which is literally affecting reality based on your thoughts which is quite literally magic.

### blah blah

the point here is that headphone bubbles are comfortable, and everyone should enjoy them as much as they can because:

- I may look like a social animal but socializing every each day is i dont fancy 
- My playlist is cool
- It makes everything else in your day feel nicer
