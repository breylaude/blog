I'm all for technological progress and modern computing. But can we please talk about Windows keyboards, which are an ergonomic nightmare?

###  I just realized that these Windows Keyboards are killing my wrist

{: .box-note}
You’re typing away, *in the zone*, and suddenly you need to hit CTRL. 

What do you do? You stretch your pinky finger all the way to the bottom-left corner of your fucking keyboard. It’s like a yoga move, but for your hand. 

{: .box-error}
Our pinkies were not designed for such acrobatics.

I mean, come on, why is ``CTRL` placed so far away? It's like the keyboard designers thought, 

*Let’s fucking put it in the most inconvenient spot possible.*

And as if that’s not enough, they throw in shortcuts like `CTRL + ALT + DEL`, practically asking us to perform finger gymnastics. 

### The Mac Advantage

I don’t want to sound like a Mac enthusiast (ok, maybe a little), but have you ever noticed the sheer genius of the `Command key` placement on Apple keyboards? It’s right there, next to the space bar, within easy reach of your thumb. 

No stretching, no contorting your hand into weird shapes, just pure ergonomic bliss.

Why can’t Windows keyboards follow suit? Is it too much to ask for a keyboard layout that doesn’t require us to dislocate our fingers to perform basic functions?

### Typing shouldn't hurt

Look, I get it. Keyboards have been around for a long time, *and change is hard*. But in an era where we’ve sent people to space and created smartphones that can unlock with our faces, surely we can come up with a keyboard layout that doesn’t inflict wrist pain on its users.

I’m not asking for a complete overhaul of the keyboard design (though, that would be nice). 

All I’m saying is, let’s consider the comfort of the people who spend hours typing away. A little ergonomic consideration could go a long way in making our digital lives a whole lot more pleasant.

### Fin

Here’s my plea to the tech gods, the keyboard designers, and anyone else who has a say in this matter: 

Let’s have a conversation about making keyboards more wrist-friendly. **Our pinkies deserve better**. And who knows, maybe one day we’ll look back at this keyboard conundrum and wonder how we ever survived the pinky-stretching era.

After all, a pain-free typing experience is something we can all get behind.
