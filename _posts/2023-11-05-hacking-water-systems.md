You have likely never worried about the possibility of a high school student doing some programming that affects your home water quality. Well, I just learnt that some municipal networks have no security between the network their schools use and the one that runs their water/wastewater facility.

This was the situation in [redacted]. The Department of Water Resources upgraded their SCADA network to industrial Ethernet. At the time there was little protection or separation of the SCADA network from the cityâ€™s IT network. While this provided many benefits it also made the controls network susceptible to malware attacks, accidental network incidents and traffic storms.

I'll finish this article tomorrow. Bye
