This is only for those who lack passion and may have a warped perception of malware and hacking.

This has just been my experience, and you must approach this with the appropriate mindset.

I’m no crazy hacker, or malware developer, but I’m learning. I also learned a great deal. And I've learned a lot about ELF binary files and Trojans (a never-ending fun endeavor).

It's actually very simple. You must have the urge to learn more about computers and truly enjoy learning the technical details of how they work. This will lead to you writing low-level applications and learning more about the operating system, Linux API—particularly C and assembler—which are both crucial and offer various perspectives on computers.

Assembly is really great. After that, programming both embedded/inline assembler and C together is like using a knife and an assembly gun. Algorithm expertise and data structures together, in my opinion, make all of these tools quite effective. To develop effective programs.

The beautiful thing about assembler is that it gets rid all of the computer abstraction levels that many languages have (which isn't terrible, but it's not helpful if you want to learn how a computer works). Plus, you WILL learn how a computer works with assembler. The functioning of memory, the CPU, so on, so on. Furthermore, C is great. Learning the ideas of assembly will definitely help in your C programming.

### Read books

Buy books, read them, or you can pirate books from this website: [pdfdrive](https://pdfdrive.com)

Books are way better than tutorials, because unlike tutorials, authors are paid well to produce computer textbooks. It is their job, and they will devote the time necessary to research, understand, and write that textbook to the best of their ability. And what's great is that even books from a decade ago are still useful, because low-level stuff never really changes, and for whatever legacy stuff you learn, emulators and virtual machines are great for that. (Not to say that tutorials are bad; use and learn from both).

Also, theoretical and practical knowledge are both crucial, so it's a good idea to read up on the theory and put it into practice through projects. For example, I've been studying a lot about the ELF Binary in Linux, as well as exploring embedded programming for microcontrollers.

This understanding of the system will help in malware development, and if you already have a strong interest in low-level programming, you will learn a lot if you are willing to study.

What I'm trying to imply is that you have to trust the process, enjoy the steps, and every learning experience so that you may develop apps. You won't be good at anything if you don't enjoy it. Not at all.

If you want you can follow my roadmap

- Learn C and the Windows API to create user-space terminal applications. (I did a lot of projects before moving on to step two, and I still do). Improve your C, memory management, and debugging skills using GDB.
- Learn and read about computer theory, including the CPU instruction set (arm assembler), bytes, bit shifting, how arithmetic works, logical operations, CPU, CPU registers, memory, and so on.
- Learn and read about computer malware, as well as how to read and learn from other people's source code. Learn the theory and create projects using what you've learned. (Incredibly vital competence in an area of learning difficult topics with little practical resources available online.)
- Not a must but you can if you want to learn about embedded microcontroller programming in order to learn more about computers and write programs on bare metal (no operating system), among other things.

This is exactly what I did. If it helps those who are unsure about what it takes to study hacking and how to get into the source code, binary level. And, honestly, you should appreciate the process more than the result, especially in this case. Most of what you learn, especially in the beginning, will be easy and will always be detected by anti-virus software. However, you should be proud when you do something major, such as embedding a basic payload inside an Elf binary and printing some text on the screen.
