Too often, we idolize a "middle" stance as more rational, more fair, more loving. We wear it as it's own kind of moral superiority.

But virtue is not synonymous with neutrality, sometimes intergrity demands a choice.

And sometimes integrity DOESN'T demand a choice. Sometimes it demands a thoughtful nuanced approach. 

So while I've been sick of the centrism and both-sidesism of msm, I'm also downright sick of what I would call the one-sidesism of the extremes of `both sides` on social media. 

There's just cringe ideologues making the most noise now. Principles are important. Being for and against something is necessary in life. But it isn't always just pick one side all the time. 

You have to know when to pick a side and when `both sides` have valid points. And btw, the latter doesn't mean they're both equally right and wrong. 

You can acknowledge both the Israelis and Palestinians have valid perspectives and still lean toward one side. I don't even think anybody should be a capitalist or a socialist. 
You should lean capitalist or socialist. Capitalists and Socialists should be able list things they like about the opposing system and dislike about their preferred system. 
I hate libertarianism and communism but I can tell you things I like about each in theory. I'm gonna say it, the far right and the far left are gonna make centrism cool again. 
They're creating a demand for it because they act so crazy on every issue.
