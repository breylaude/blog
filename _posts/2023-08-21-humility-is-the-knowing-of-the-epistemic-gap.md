Humility is knowing that you don’t know a lot of things, not a false pretension to deceive people into praising you.

The contemporary view of humility seems to be to pretend as if one knew little instead of realizing it. Here *fake it till you make it* doesn’t seem to work, the more you pretend to be humble without realizing how little you know—not relatively, but absolutely—-the ego grows by holding onto the relative superiority.

Most of the issue of not understanding the fragility of one’s epistemic confidence arises due to comparison, but more often than not [comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline](https://breylaude.github.io/blog/2023-08-21-comparison-based-on-comparison-doesnt-have-a-baseline/)
