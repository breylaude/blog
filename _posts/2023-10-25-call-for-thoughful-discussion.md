Too often, we idolize a "middle" stance as more rational, more fair, more equitable. We wear it as a symbol of moral superiority.

But virtue is not identical with neutrality; sometimes integrity necessitates a decision and a thoughtful, nuanced approach.

So while I've been sick of the centrism and bothsidesism of the mainstream media, I'm also downright sick of what I would call the one-sidesism of the extremes of `both sides` on social media. 

There are just cringe-worthy ideologues making the most noise right now. Principles are vital. Being for and against something is an essential part of life. However, it is not always necessary to take one side over another.

You must understand when to take a side and when 'both sides' have valid points. And, by the way, this does not imply that they are equally right and incorrect. 

You can admit that both Israelis and Palestinians have valid points of view while still leaning toward one side. I don't believe somebody should be a capitalist or a socialist. 

You should lean towards capitalism or socialism. Capitalists and socialists should be able to identify what they enjoy about the opposing system and dislike about their preferred system.

I hate libertarianism, but I can tell you what I appreciate about each in theory. I'm going to say it: the far right and far left are going to make centrism popular again. 

They're creating a demand for it because they act so crazy on every issue.
